Here are the inferred cluster descriptions for each cluster:

**Cluster 1: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms in Python**

This cluster focuses on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. The code snippets demonstrate common tasks such as string reversal, factorial calculation, prime number checking, list searching and sorting, and basic operations on stacks, queues, linked lists, and hash tables.

**Cluster 2: Heron Cluster Management and Monitoring**

This cluster contains code related to managing and monitoring a Heron (a stream processing engine) cluster, particularly in a standalone deployment.  The code includes functionalities for starting and stopping the cluster, setting configurations, retrieving cluster information, distributing packages, templating configuration files, and interacting with Heron's API and monitoring tools. The queries also include functions for managing tuples within a Heron bolt (a processing unit).
