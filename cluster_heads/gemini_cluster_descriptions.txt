Here are the inferred cluster descriptions for each cluster:

*   **Cluster 1:** Miscellaneous utility functions and operations. This cluster includes code snippets for a variety of tasks such as parsing addresses, creating webhooks, sorting files, calculating statistics, handling dependencies, rendering images, and managing security groups.

*   **Cluster 2:** Basic file operations and data manipulation tasks. This cluster includes code snippets for file reading/writing, image processing, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations.

*   **Cluster 3:** Data processing, algorithm implementation, and API interaction. This cluster contains code snippets for implementing algorithms (Fibonacci, BFS, Bubble Sort), data manipulation, interacting with external APIs (MailChimp), and working with data structures.
